<h1>Puppy decisions</h1>
<p>It is soon to be almost 9 months ago we lost our dear Labrador Retriever, Prudence.  While I no longer think about her every day, when she pops
    into my mind periodically, my heart clenches and I still feel momentary disbelief and sadness that she's gone.  But on the
    brighter side, we're starting to think it might be almost time for a new puppy.  We've even got a name: CC (cup cake).
    Though we are not sure of what breed. 
    <br> <br>
    Well, correction, my husband is sure the puppy should be exactly as Prudence was, a
    black Labrador Retriever.  I, on the other hand, mostly agree but I'd like to keep my options open.<br>
    I will now outline the pros and cons of our 3 candidates:</p>
